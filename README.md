Automation Tools Bootcamp
=========================

A series of discussions about the development tools that enable automation of software projects.

Always Be Learning
==================
It is important to not just do what's been done because that is the way we have operated in the past. http://programming.oreilly.com/2014/01/7-ways-to-be-a-better-programmer-in-2014.html#two

The [Developer Automation Tools Bootcamp](http://tfitch.com/automation-tools-bootcamp) is a series of topics for individuals looking for exposure to and usage of new development tools.  A progression of tasks, leveraging information from previous sessions to build a small app that runs identically on your local development computer or on a shared server.

Benefits of the bootcamp:
=========================
* You'll get rid of the "it works for me" mentality when you know your local VM is identical to your co-workers and your shared environments.
* Exposure to new tools: Odds are, you aren't using everyone of these tools in your development tasks. Hopefully there is something to learn for everyone. If not, please send a Pull Request with the desired topic to the `index.html` page on the `gh-pages` branch.
* See the full application automation stack start to finish. Jenkins jobs aren't some voodoo that need to be setup for you. It should be doing exactly what you do locally to compile. If it is your app, you're the best person to create the Jenkins job to build it! Never installed a webserver on a Linux box? You will.
* Be a polyglot (if you're not already). You'll end up using Markdown, Ruby (for Chef) and JavaScript (for Node.js) while going through these lessons. This is a good thing.
* Learning is often more fun when it is collaborative.
