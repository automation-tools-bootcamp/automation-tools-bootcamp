<img src="./images/chef-logo.png" align="right" />
<p>Of all the bootcamp subjects to cover this one is the most frustrating to present properly in one hour.  We will be able to cover "Why Chef exists," and "What Chef is," but not as much about "How Chef does it".  That said, with the info here you will create a simple cookbook to configure a server.</p>

<h3><a name="why-chef" class="anchor" href="#why-chef"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What problems does Chef solve?</h3>

Chef is an <em>Infrastructure Automation Frameworks</em>, so that it's more than a tool, a language or a single product. The issues Chef addresses include:
<ul>
  <li>How to specify what a system does as a description of state, instead of an aggregation of Bash/Perl/Python scripts.
  <li>How to maintain many systems over time in a consistent, repeatable manner (where 'many' is anywhere between 1 and 250,000)
  <li>How to assure that machines in identical <em>roles</em> behave the same in different environments, e.g. between dev, staging and production.
  <li>How to verify and test your changes before touching anything in your live infrastructure.
</ul>

The end goal: <strong>You can rebuild your entire infrastructure</strong> from your version-control system, your data-layer backup, and fresh hardware.

Starting analogy: "Chef is to systems as yum/apt are to package management"

<h3><a name="chef-from-chef" class="anchor" href="#chef-from-chef"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Chef is a product from <a href="http://www.chef.io/" target="_new">Chef</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Chef will install and configure software for your server (or VM of a server) - or even your laptop if you wanted.</li>
  <li>Chef is a Ruby DSL (domain-specific languate). Knowing Ruby is helpful but not required.</li>
  <li>Almost everything from <a href="https://github.com/chef" target="_new">Chef is open source</a>.  Including the <a href="https://github.com/chef-cookbooks" target="_new">community <it>cookbooks</it> Chef maintains</a>.</li>
  <li>You write <it>recipes</it> which are stored in cookbooks.  A <it>knife</it> does most of the work.  (LOTS of cooking-related names.)</li>
  <li>It is assumed you are using version-control with Chef, generally Git.  Git is not required, but some tools in the Chef ecosystem will actually try and execute Git commands.</li>
  <li>Chef and its ecosystem of tools are advancing at a pace I've rarely seen in a tool.  It is *hard* to keep to up date (and it's my part of my job).</li>
  <li>Wanna learn how to do something in a Chef cookbook?  Cookbooks in the <a href="https://supermarket.chef.io" target="_new">Chef Supermarket</a> have examples of just about everything. Don't reinvent the wheel.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="best-practices" class="anchor" href="#best-practices"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>All the best practices of software development are available</h3>

<p>The Ruby community is excellent at the practice of TDD (Test Driven Development).  This has, thankfully, carried over to the Chef community, which has developed a suite of testing tools. These tools may add some time to your development initially, but their use pays off quickly, and they help increase both your velocity <em>and</em> stability in the long run.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dependency management - <a href="http://berkshelf.com/" target="_new">Berkshelf</a></li>
  <li>Code linting - <a href="http://www.foodcritic.io/" target="_new">Foodcritic</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop" target="_new">Rubocop</a></li>
  <li>Unit Testing - <a href="http://code.sethvargo.com/chefspec/" target="_new">ChefSpec</a></li>
  <li>Integration Testing - <a href="http://kitchen.ci/" target="_new">Test Kitchen</a></li>
  <li>All these tools are so useful, Chef bundled them together into <a href="http://docs.chef.io/devkit/" target="_new">the Chef DK.</a></li>
  <li>Automation of linting, unit testing and interation testing after a code check in can be done in Countinuous Integration tools like <a href="./jenkins.html">Jenkins</a>, just like building other software projects</li>
  <li>Successful completion of the above steps within your CI server would indicate a working cookbook change and your CI server can then publish the change to the Chef server for managed machines to pull down the update and apply it.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting started</h3>

<p><a href="http://learnchef.com" target="_new">LearnChef</a> has well-crafted tutorials based on your prefered client OS, as well as numerous other webinars and tutorials.  The site provisions a virtual machine for you during the guided tours. Follow the steps as described and you'll accomplish more in an hour than you'd expect!</p>

<h3><a name="server-client" class="anchor" href="#server-client"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Chef Server/Client</h3>

<p>All of the configuration of your node is done by the <em>Chef Client</em>. That client (sometimes called an agent) processes a <em>runlist</em> of cookbooks, evaluates them based on the node's <em>attributes</em>, and then fixes any resources on the node that aren't yet matching the cookbook description.</p>

<p>The Chef Server stores the cookbooks and node information for Chef Clients. The Chef Client's interacts with the Chef Server over a REST API, and when you need to update cookbooks or other site information you use that API too, through tools like <em>knife</em> or the server's web Manage UI.</p>

<p>Whether you are using <code>knife</code> or the Chef Server's Manage UI, they will end up showing you the same information as gathered from the Server via those REST API requests.  In some mature Chef environments users will not even have the Chef Manage UI installed on their Chef Server and instead they just use <code>knife</code> commands to request the information they need to know about their Chef managed nodes.</p>

<h3><a name="the-wheel" class="anchor" href="#the-wheel"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Do not reinvent the wheel</h3>

<p>Now that we've covered that - here's the secret to Chef.  <a href="https://supermarket.chef.io" target="_new">It's all been done before!!!</a>  In the same way that Java has Maven, Ruby has gems or Node has npm for getting libraries people have already created - Chef has community cookbooks.  They're open source - use them *and* learn from them.<br />
<br />
Need Java?  <a href="https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/java" target="_new">Use the community cookbook!</a><br />
Need Tomcat? <a href="https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/tomcat" target="_new">Use the community cookbook!</a><br />
Need MongoDB? <a href="https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/mongodb" target="_new">Use the community cookbook!</a><br />
<br />
For a generic install of MongoDB using the community cookbook it is two lines of code added to your cookbook.<br>
<pre><code># in metadata.rb file
depends 'mongodb'

# in default.rb file
include_recipe 'mongodb'
</code></pre>
DONE AND DONE.  MongoDB is installed.</p>

<h3><a name="have-to" class="anchor" href="#have-to"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Do not reinvent the wheel (unless you have to)</h3>
<p>The community cookbooks are robust and often, but not always, support a wide range of configuration options (like host name, app install directory).<br />
<br />
BUT - sometimes (read: often) the community cookbook just isn't right.  Go ahead and roll your own.  Spin up a base Vagrant VM.  Run some commands to install your software just the way you need.  Then use those commands as the model for writing your cookbook with Chef resources, such as <em>package</em>, <em>file</em>, and <em>service</em>.   Now you can reproduce your app install as many times as needed.  OR - contribute a change back to the community cookbook via a GitHub Pull Request.  <a href="http://tfitch.github.io/automation-tools-bootcamp/git-workflows.html#fork-pull-request" target="_new">We know how to do that.</a>
</p>

<h3><a name="create-cookbook" class="anchor" href="#create-cookbook"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Create our first cookbook</h3>
<p><a href="http://docs.chef.io/devkit/getting_started.html#your-first-cookbook" target="_new">Generating your first cookbook</a> starts with the <code>chef generate cookbook &lt;your_cookbook_name&gt;</code> command.<br />
<br />
This will give you a directory structure with all files necessary stubbed out.  Let's just dig in to the <code>recipes/default.rb</code> file and use it to install Apache 2.
<pre><code># in recipes/default.rb
package 'apache2' do
  action :install
end
</code></pre>
You've done it.  Apache 2 will be installed when Chef Client runs.  Congrats.
</p>

<h3><a name="test-kitchen" class="anchor" href="#test-kitchen"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Test Kitchen</h3>
<img src="./images/test_kitchen.png" align="right" width="300" />
<p>
Very good. Now to test it. A few years ago, you'd approach testing like this: a) have a Chef Server handy, b) upload the cookbook to the server, c) install the chef-client on a Vagrant VM, d) register the Vagrant VM with the Chef Server, e) converge the node, and f) verify that your cookbook worked. Sounds like a pain in the butt and it was.  With some Vagrant plugins the process was bearable, but still clunky.<br />
<br />
But <a href="https://github.com/fnichol" target="_new">Flether Nichol</a> decided we should have a better experience and instead created <a href="http://kitchen.ci/" target="_new">Test Kitchen</a>.  Similar to the joy that Mitchell Hashimoto delivered by putting VM settings in a Vagrantfile, Fletcher took Configuration Management testing to the next step and now we create <code>.kitchen.yml</code> files to describe our tests.<br />
<br />
To test our cookbook, we'll run <code>kitchen converge</code>.  It'll spin up your desired machine with your <a href="https://rubygems.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=kitchen-" target="_new">desired driver</a> (Vagrant, Docker, AWS, OpenStack, etc), fake out a Chef Server with Chef Zero (or use a real Chef Server if that's your thing), and do a Chef client run of your cookbook.<br />
When that completes (barring any errors in your cookbook), test the changes with  <code>kitchen verify</code>. Or you can log in to the VM and check things out manually (<code>kitchen login</code>).  All of which is driven by the data in your .kitchen.yml file.

<h3><a name="workout" class="anchor" href="#workout"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Workout</h3>

<p>We are going to complete the following actions</p>
<ol>
  <li>Review the <a href="https://github.com/tfitch/automation-tools-bootcamp/tree/master/chef/automation-tools" target="_new">example cookbook</a> which you checked out during the Git session.</li>
  <li>Edit the <code>recipes/default.rb</code> file to install Apache 2 using the <code>apache2</code> <a href="https://docs.chef.io/resource_package.html" target="_new">package</a>.</li>
  <li>Converge the node with Test Kitchen <code>kitchen converge</code>. Note the output of the <code>chef-client</code> run.</li>
  <li>Browse to the VM in your browser: <a href="http://localhost:8080" target="_new">http://localhost:8080</a>.</li>
  <li>Connect to the VM via SSH (<code><a href="http://kitchen.ci/docs/getting-started/getting-help" target="_new">kitchen login</a></code>) and then stop the Apache server from running <code>sudo service apache2 stop</code> and logout. Reload the webpage (boo, nothing there).</li>
  <li>Run <code>kitchen verify</code>. Does the test pass?
  <li>Run <code>kitchen converge</code> again. How is the output from <code>chef-client</code> different this time?
  <li>Run <code>kitchen verify</code> again. Does the test pass now?
